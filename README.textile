h2. About

urxvt is a great terminal emulator, but spending time on a mac made me miss the ability (in iTerm!) to dynamically resize text using ⌘+Plus and ⌘+Minus.  I was also thinking that it would be be nice if resizing the terminal font could be persisted to @Xresources@.  Turns out this was pretty easy to accomplish.

bc. urxvt.perl-lib:                     /path/to/urxvt-font
urxvt.keysym.Control-Shift-Up:      perl:font:increment
urxvt.keysym.Control-Shift-Down:    perl:font:decrement
urxvt.perl-ext-common:              font

Now, @Ctrl+Shift+<Up>@ and @Ctrl+Shift+<Down>@ will, respectively, enlarge and decrease the text size in a running urxvt window, *and* save the new font size to @~/.Xresources@, so that it's there for the next time you open a terminal window.  With the Monaco font, it's a poor man's iTerm.

h2.

I keep my fonts in a separate xresources file, which gets include by @~/.Xresources@.  This way I can version @~/.Xdefaults@ without dirtying the repository every time I change the terminal font size.  For this to work, the path defined by @X_RESOURCES@ in @font@ must contain something like this:

bc.  /* Fonts */
urxvt*boldColors: on
urxvt*font:     xft:Monaco:pixelsize=20:antialias=true:hinting=true:medium
urxvt*boldFont: xft:Monaco:pixelsize=20:antialias=true:hinting=true:bold
! vim:ft=xdefaults
